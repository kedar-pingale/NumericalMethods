# NumericalMethods

This library has Fundamental numerical linear algebra methods and some basic matrix operations

To use library.
1)You can use main.cpp to write your own code OR
2)You can include Matrix.hpp file in your own code just like i have included in main.cpp

Entire code is written in C++. 
Class data members, member functions declarations are kept in Matrix.hpp file and definitions of all member functions are in Matrix.cpp file.

Way to mention matrix in file:

r c

m11 m12 m13 ... m1c

m21 m22 m23 ... m2c

.	  .	

.		    .

.			      .

mr1 mr2 mr3 ... mrc


e.g.:

3 3

12 667 34.996788

6 23 9999.999

45 125 3.141592

Note: Keep 1 space between any two elements in a row and every row on new line.
